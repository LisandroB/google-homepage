i mostly used google for this assignment. tons of stuff i had to remember and implement. the html was completely built by me, it was a huge pain in the ass but i learned a ton thanks to this. from The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css) <3.
